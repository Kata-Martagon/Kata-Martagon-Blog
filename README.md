# Kata-Martagon-Blog
Blog project for F&amp;C

## Task
To create a simple blog using html/css and javascript that will be used to link to projects and information about team members.

## How?
Initially build a page with two columns. THe right hand side column will scrill, giving and introduction or information about individual projects. The left hand side will remain fixed but will show a picture or other display that is linked to the projects
There will also be another page giving details on the members of the team with links to their online profiles like codewars, Linkedin etc.

## Stretch goals
- Add animations to the scolling and fixed sides to make the transitions between projects smoother.
- Use JS to make transitions beautiful.
